/**
 * Rules:
 * - all nodes must be linked to other nodes.  There can be no orphan nodes.
 * - node names must be unique
 * - two nodes can have zero or one link connecting them
 * - all end nodes should draw to the screen
 *
 * => it is always possible to find the start nodes
 * => there are certain valid valve combinations
 *
 * --------------
 * Q: how do we deal with recursion?  Pipe the outputs of one node to the inputs of another in the next loop?
 * i.e. particles writes textureP and reads textureB
 * body reads textureP and writes textureB
 *
 * we know to flip textureB after writing to it, because anything else will only read from the new texture.
 * => So we link back via doubleTextures
 * --------------
 *
 * Any other difficult questions....
 *
 * Q: Once we have a map, how do we add an instance?
 *
 * Any instance must flow from a start node to the end node
 * Certain things are shared across instances
 *
 * Scenario: load and draw the restaurant.
 * The most basic:  We have a single draw drawing untextured vertices to the screen.
 * We add each instance. We need to add vertexData and uniform data only.
 * We can add another instance by adding vertex data
 *
 * More advanced: We want to add shadows to certain objects.
 * For a shadow, we draw all casting objects to the same texture.
 * We then use that texture when drawing all objects to the screen.
 * => we add an instance of a shadow casting object, which means we draw it to the texture
 *
 * Even mode advanced: We want to add lights to certain objects.
 * We draw them with a light source.
 *
 * We want to add bumpmapping to certain objects.
 * We draw them with a normal map.
 *
 * So if we want a shadow casting, bumpmapped, lit object, we go through all the steps.
 *
 * Consider we have multilpe light sources.

Imagine we have two nodes, both with the same buffer.
For a given model (table), we want to add it

  addInstance table => {

  so for each node, we specify the data given a model
  we then have all of the instance data.

What we have missed:
 - constraining buffers
 - constraining animations
 - pixel draws
 - by default, point buffers are treated like any other
